## Rust - [2. Programming a Guessing Game](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

### Summary
- At this point, you’ve successfully built the guessing game. Congratulations!

- This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: let, match, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next few chapters, you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.
